Ask the user to enter five card ranks (numbers between 1 and 13).
Store the first card as rank1, and set rank1’s count to 1.
Look at the second card:
If it matches rank1, increase rank1’s count.
Otherwise, store it as rank2 and set rank2’s count to 1.
Look at the third card:
If it matches rank1, increase rank1’s count.
If it doesn’t match rank1 and rank2 is not yet set, make it rank2 and set rank2’s count to 1.
If it matches rank2, increase rank2’s count.
Look at the fourth card, and repeat the same steps as with the third card
Look at the fifth card, and repeat the same steps as with the third card.
After checking all cards, see if the counts are 3 and 2 in any order.
If yes, display “This hand is a Poker Full House.”
If not, display “This hand is not a Poker Full House.”
