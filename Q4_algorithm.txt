Start
Input 5 card numbers → a, b, c, d, e.
Check if each card number is between 1 and 13.
If any number is invalid → Output "INVALID CARD VALUE, MUST BE BETWEEN 1-13" and Stop.
Initialize an array count[1..13] with all values = 0.
Increment the frequency of each entered card:

count[a] = count[a] + 1
count[b] = count[b] + 1
count[c] = count[c] + 1
count[d] = count[d] + 1
count[e] = count[e] + 1

Initialize two variables: three = 0, two = 0.
For each card value from 1 to 13 (done without loop in your program):

If count[i] = 3, set three = 1.
If count[i] = 2, set two = 1.

After all checks, test the condition:

If three = 1 AND two = 1, then Output "The Hand Is A Full House".
OTHERWISE, Output "The Hand Is Not A Full House".

Stop
